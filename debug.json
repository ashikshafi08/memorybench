      "actual": "Chloroplasts are organelles found in plant cells and eukaryotic algae that conduct photosynthesis. They absorb sunlight and convert it into chemical energy by utilizing water and carbon dioxide gas to synthesize glucose and other organic compounds that serve as food for the plant. This foundational cellular structure is essential for autotrophic life on Earth, enabling the conversion of solar energy into forms usable by plants and, indirectly, by all other organisms in the food chain.\n\nParis is ",
